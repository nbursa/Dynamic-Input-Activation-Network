# Dynamic-Input-Activation-Network

## Overview

This repository contains the code and research paper for the project "Dynamic Input Activation in Neural Networks for Enhanced Learning and Adaptability". The project introduces a novel neural network architecture with dynamic input activation and an intuition module to enhance learning and adaptability.

## Structure

- `data/`: Directory for datasets.
- `runs/`: Directory for model checkpoints and logs.
- `src/`: Source code directory.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for experiments.
- `figures/`: Directory for storing figures and plots.
- `README.md`: Project description and instructions.
- `paper.md`: The research paper.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nbursa/Dynamic-Input-Activation-Network.git
   cd Dynamic-Input-Activation-Network
   ```

2. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the dataset (if applicable) and place it in the `data/` directory.

## Usage

1. Train the model:

   ```bash
   python src/train.py
   ```

2. View the results:
   - The training logs and model checkpoints will be saved in the `runs/` directory.
   - Generated plots and figures will be saved in the `figures/` directory.
